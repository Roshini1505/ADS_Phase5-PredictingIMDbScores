## Introduction

This project involves the analysis and visualization of Netflix original content data. It covers various aspects such as data loading, data cleaning, and data visualization to gain insights into Netflix's original content.

## Data Overview

The main dataset used for this analysis is `NetflixOriginals.csv`, which contains information about Netflix original movies and TV shows. Additionally, there's another dataset, `NetflixOriginals.csv`, which is used for a second part of the analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-originals-analysis.git
   cd netflix-originals-analysis
   
Install the required libraries:
-pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
-Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to analyze the data and create visualizations.

Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves handling missing values and converting date columns to the datetime format. We also removed rows with missing values to ensure data quality.

Data Visualization
This project includes various data visualizations to better understand the Netflix original content data, such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots. These visualizations provide insights into the content's duration, release year, and more.

Additional Dataset Analysis
In the second part of the code, an additional dataset (NetflixOriginals.csv) is used for analysis. This dataset is explored, and relationships between runtime and IMDb scores are visualized.
